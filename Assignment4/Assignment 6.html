      <hr size="2" width="100%">
      <div align="left">In this assignment you will:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>complete the stack class that you started work on in lab</li>
          <li>write a queue class that implements the queue interface<br>
          </li>
          <li>write a program that uses your stack and queue classes to
            evaluate postfix expressions</li>
        </ul>
        Part 1 - complete the Stack class that you started in lab.&nbsp;
        <br>
        <br>
        Part 2 - write a Queue class.&nbsp; Define ElementType as
        string. You may use a static array, a dynamic array or a linked
        list as the data structure.&nbsp; If you use a dynamically
        allocated array or a linked list you will need to provide a
        destructor.&nbsp; You do not need to provide an assignment
        operator or a copy constructor.&nbsp; If you use an array your
        queue must be capable of holding up to capacity number of items
        and the push and pop operations must be O(1).&nbsp; This means
        you will have to treat the array as if it were circular (as
        discussed in class on Thursday).&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        Part 3 - write a well decomposed program that:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>for each line of an input file<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Reads a postfix expression from an input file (the
              program user must be able to enter the name of the file to
              be read from) and stores the tokens that make up the
              expression in a queue of tokens (strings).&nbsp; <br>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Evaluates the postfix expression.&nbsp; The function
              that does the evaluation (algorithm is given below and in
              the Unit 4 slides) will make use of a stack of operands
              (ints).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Writes to a text file the postfix expression and the
              result of evaluating it.<br>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        You may find the atoi() function from &lt;cstdlib&gt; useful.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Algorithm to evaluate a postfix expression</b><br>
        <br>
        create an empty stack<br>
        while there are more tokens in the postfix expression<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get the next token<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the token is an operand
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; push it onto the stack<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the token is an
        operator<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get and pop the top two operands from the
        stack<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; apply the operator to these two operands<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; push the result onto the stack<br>
        &nbsp;the top of the stack is the result of evaluating the
        postfix expression<br>
        <br>
        The text file that contains the postfix expressions will have
        the following format.&nbsp; Each line will contain one postfix
        expression.&nbsp;&nbsp; All operands with be integers and the
        only operators will be +, * and -.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tokens (operators
        and operands) will be separated by at least one blank and the
        character # will mark the end of a postfix expression.&nbsp; An
        example of an input file follows:<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 23 4 *
        19 2 - + #<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6 3
        -&nbsp; #<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 36 #<br>
        <br>
        You can assume that the input file is formatted as described
        above and that all infix expressions are legal. You can assume
        that the last character on each line will be a #.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        The output file your program creates as a result of the reading
        the input file shown above should look something like:<br>
        <br>
        The result of evaluating&nbsp; 23 4 * 19 2 - + &nbsp; is 109<br>
        The result of evaluating 6 3 - is 3<br>
        The result of evaluating 36 is 36 <br>
